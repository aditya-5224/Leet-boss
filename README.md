##📊 Complexity Analysis

+ Time Complexity: O(n)  → Single pass
+ Space Complexity: O(min(m, n)) → Stores last seen indices
🎯 Visualization
Copy
Input: "abcabcbb"
Step-by-Step Window:
1. "a" → len=1  
2. "ab" → len=2  
3. "abc" → len=3 (max)  
4. "bca" → len=3  
5. "cab" → len=3  
6. "abc" → len=3  
7. "cb" → len=2  
8. "b" → len=1

### **Why This Format Works**  
1. **Syntax Highlighting** → Code blocks render with colors.  
2. **Emoji Dividers** → Visually separates sections.  
3. **Badges** → LinkedIn/LeetCode links stand out.  
4. **Diff Highlighting** → Green `+` for complexity analysis.  
5. **Tree Structure** → Clear folder hierarchy.  

### **Preview Tips**  
- Use **[Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/)** in VS Code for live rendering.  
- Test on GitHub’s **README preview** before committing.  

Want me to tweak anything? 😊
give me the entire code at once so that i can copy paste
Here's the complete, copy-paste-friendly README.md code for your LeetCode solutions repository with enhanced visual styling:
